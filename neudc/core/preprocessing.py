# This module contains preprocessing classes for images.
# Those classes must have __call__ methods implemented, that
# take an image as an input and output an image or torch.tensor, 
# or a numpy.ndarray. Classes have to be similar to torchvision.transforms.
# Frame undistortion has to be implemented here as a function.
